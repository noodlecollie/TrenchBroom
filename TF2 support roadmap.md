## V0 (minimum required)

* Use an asset scheme where content is sourced from VPKs, plus directories on disk.
* Add support for reading VPKs and VMT/VTF files for textures.
* Add support for reading TF2 FGD. If there's fancy stuff in there (eg. entity I/O), just ignore it for now.
* Add support for exporting MAP to VMF. Unclear whether this would be better implemented as an external utility or an internal routine.

## V1

* Add support for reading MDL files for models.
* Add support for entity I/O.

## V2

* Add support for displacement editing (geometry and blending).

## V2+ (QoL)

* Rendering of particle systems.
* Easier texture/model browsing.
* Viewing collision models.
